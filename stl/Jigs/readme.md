#Soldering Jigs

##Prep
You should have the jst connectors soldered to your larger boards 

You will need one each of Jig 1 and Jig 2, and two of Jig 3.

Screw a spare of the larger board to Jig 1, then attach one of Jig 3 to the bottom so it will sit flat. You can use the raised part of Jig 3 to glue it to Jig 3 with something you can remove later, so you can take it apart if you need the board back.


##Step 1
Screw a smaller board into Jig 1. Drop some component legs into the holes, Jig 3 will act as a stop keeping them from falling all the way through. Solder them on, then trim them.

##Step 2
Screw the larger board to the module, then slip the legs we just soldered on into place, screw down the small board, and place upside-down in Jig 2. Solder the legs, then trim.

##Step 3
Place a hall sensor into the splay spot, so that it faces toward the center of the circle, away from the main body of the sensor. Place it onto Jig 3 and solder the legs, then trim. Save the legs for the next module. The sensor will protrude a tiny amount, this is intentional.

##Step 4
Place hall sensors into the Sin and Cos slots. Sin should face away from the center of the circle, towards the main body. Cos should face towards the center of the circle. Place the module into Jig 2 again, solder the legs, and trim. Save these legs seperately, they're shorter and therefore harder to work with, but the legs are super easy to drop on the floor so these will serve as spares.

##Step 5
Place a 3-pin header into a 3-pin connector. Jig 3 will make it easier to hold it in place while you tack one of the legs. Remove the connector and solder the header.

##You Are Done
Pat yourself on the back. Proceed to mechanical assembly
